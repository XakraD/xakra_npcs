# xakra_npcs

# Description
With this script you will be able to add peds wherever you want, mainly to decorate sites with peds. For example, some mapping or some uninhabited area.

In order for the npc to be at ground level, the Z coordinates must be lowered according to the character's height: vector4(X, Y, Z - CHARACTER HEIGHT, H)

In the Config file you can change:
- Npc coordinates
- Npc model
- Choose the weapon that will be equipped or without a weapon
- Outfit number or random (false)

## Instructions to incorporate script
- Copy the script into a folder (to choose) from the 'resources' folder.
- Add 'ensure xakra_npcs' in the 'resources.cfg' document.
